Group project 2
In this project we called the yelp API for restaurant information in San Francisco and display it on a map with the category of your chosen and a custom rating system that combines both price and rating. The restaurants with higher rating score will be displayed with a bigger icon, with the top 3 places being marked with medals. This makes it easier for you to find the best restaurants based on your preference with yelp.
This project is done mostly with javascript, with the help of python and mongoDB. We used python to pull data stored in mongoDB based on the user's input from HTML, then passed the data as jsonified object to javascript, and runs a javascrip function for deciding the ranking and display the medals and icon sizes on the mapbox map in html.
